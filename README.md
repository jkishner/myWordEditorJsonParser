# myWordEditorJsonParser

This is some javascript to print out (into the DOM) the title and body markdown from an essay produced by Dave Winer's [MyWord Editor](http://myword.io/editor/). 

After you view your backup json (choose from the editor menu), enter that url into the input field. Then enter the number of the essay you want to view.

Due to cross-origin resource sharing problems, this script does not work "online," but it works fine if you download the html file to your hard drive, and then open the file in a web browser.
